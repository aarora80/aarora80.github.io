# About 👨🏽‍💻

Hello World👋! I am a current Undergraduate student at Arizona State University studying **Computer Science**, **Statistics**, and **Economics**! 📕
Currently, through my research, coursework, and projects, I am gaining experience in Software and Machine Learning fields, ranging:

- Full-Stack Development 💻
- Mathematical Statistics and Algorithm Analysis 📈
- Data Science 📊
- Computer Vision 🤖
- Natural Language Processing 🤖
- Recommender Systems 🤖

Recently, I have worked for **Qualitest** - an AI-Led Quality Engineering Company, as a **Machine Learning Engineer Intern** where I:

- Built end-to-end applications to integrate various testing models.
- Designed an AI interface to automate Quality Assurance Testing using machine learning models and artificial intelligence.
- Collaborated on optimizing feature selection for their Qualisense model powered by OpenAI.

I am currently working as an **Undergraduate Research Assistant** under **Dr. YooJung Choi**, conducting research at a probabilistic reasoning and learning lab, focusing on trustworthy AI/ML and advanced probabilistic models. My current project involves:

- Developing methods for image inpainting using Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and Probabilistic Factor Graphs (PFGs).
- Training these models on a diverse dataset of images with missing sections.
- Enhancing their capability in reconstructing and enhancing images reliably.

This work demonstrates the application of probabilistic models in solving real-world challenges in computer vision, particularly in image restoration.


I am also an avid Indian Classical Music Performer and Enthusiast! 🎤🎶
