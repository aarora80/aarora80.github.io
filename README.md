# About 👨🏽‍💻

Hello World👋! I am a current Undergraduate student at Arizona State University studying **Computer Science**, **Statistics**, and **Economics**! 📕
Currently, through my research, coursework, and projects, I am gaining experience in Software and Machine Learning fields, ranging:

- Full-Stack Development 💻
- Mathematical Statistics and Algorithm Analysis 📈
- Data Science and Intelligent Analytics 📊
- Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling  🤖
- Representation Learning and Perception (CV/NLP) 🧠
- Generative AI and Recommender Systems 🎯

Recently, I am working at <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae52bef1-9f47-4deb-8c3c-48c42408787a" alt="Intel Logo" width="90"/> as an **AI/ML Software Engineering Intern**,
where I am contributing to:

- Next-gen internal platforms that harness advanced AI for intelligent information discovery
- Adaptive ML systems for automating complex workflows
- Robust pipelines enabling real-time, AI-driven insights at scale


I am also currently working as an **Undergraduate Research Assistant** under **Dr. YooJung Choi**, conducting research at a probabilistic reasoning and learning lab, focusing on trustworthy AI/ML and advanced probabilistic models. My current project involves:

- Developing methods for image inpainting using Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and Probabilistic Factor Graphs (PFGs).
- Training these models on a diverse dataset of images with missing sections.
- Enhancing their capability in reconstructing and enhancing images reliably.

This work demonstrates the application of probabilistic models in solving real-world challenges in computer vision, particularly in image restoration.


I am also an avid Indian Classical Music Performer and Enthusiast! 🎤🎶
